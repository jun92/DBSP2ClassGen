# DBSP2ClassGen
Generate C# classes for calling &amp; retreiving data of MSSQL's stored procedures. 

Welcome to the DBSP2ClassGen wiki!

When you start using MS SQL servers. DBA in your company said "please use stored procedures!!", "please make sure the procedure can use execute-plan!! need to hit cache!! blah blah.". so we -poor programmers- are typing and typing all-day the code making procedure, declaring a tons of parameters, binding them all so long so far.

now. I strongly recommand you don't need that any longer. just make a procedure in your database and run this program. it will make source code for you to make a classes for using all procedures in your DB.

it's v0.1 now, and I have several ideas to make it more helpful and practical. it will be kept updating. thanks.
